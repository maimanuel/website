## My Life Story in 102 Words

I was born and raised in Hagen, Germany. Growing up, I enjoyed school
and playing team Handball. After high school, I went to study Physics in
Heidelberg and at UCONN.

Bringing only one suitcase and a backpack, I moved to the US to earn a
Ph.D.Â at Yale. Since graduating, I have worked in Data Science and
Machine Learning across various industries - Fintech, Adtech, Fashion.
Currently, I am at Spotify.

After over 10 years in the US, I moved back to Germany. One suitcase and
a backpack had turned into a small house worth of stuff, a dog, and a
wife.
